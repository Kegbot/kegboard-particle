# kegboard-particle

Flow sensor controller firmware for [Particle](https://www.particle.io/)
[Photon](https://www.particle.io/products/hardware/photon-wifi-dev-kit) and
[Electron](https://www.particle.io/products/hardware/electron-cellular-dev-kit)
hardware. Provides meter readings over serial port and Wifi (Photon) or cellular
(Electron) network connections.

## Build and Flash

To build and flash your particle device, load the `main.ino` file into the [Particle IDE](https://build.particle.io/build) and flash it to your device. That's it!

## Wiring

The following pins are configured:

* `D1` - Flow meter `meter0`
* `D2` - Flow meter `meter1`
* `D3` - Flow meter `meter2`
* `D4` - Flow meter `meter3`

Most flow meters require a [pull-up resistor](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/pull-up-resistors) for proper operation. Consult your meter's documentation.

## Reading Data

There are three ways to read meter data from the device:

* Serial interface: Connect directly to the serial port. This interface is always running.
* TCP interface: Connect to the device on a TCP port.
* Cloud interface: Publishes a message to the Particle cloud using [Particle.publish()](https://community.particle.io/t/tutorial-getting-started-with-spark-publish/3422). This interface is active when no TCP clients are connected.

### TCP Interface

The firmware runs a TCP server on port `8321` where meter readings are
published. A single client at a time can connect to this port.

Example:

```
$ telnet 192.168.1.7 8321
info: kegboard-particle device_id=1234abcd1234abcd00001111 version=0.1.0
kb-status: meter0.ticks=0 meter1.ticks=0 meter2.ticks=0 meter3.ticks=0
kb-status: meter0.ticks=16 meter1.ticks=0 meter2.ticks=0 meter3.ticks=0
```

#### Service Discovery with mDNS (Bonjour)

The device will broadcast the mDNS hostname `kegboard`. On Mac OS X, you can typically locate the device with the hostname `kegboard.local` rather than by IP:

```
$ telnet kegboard.local 8321
Trying 192.168.86.100...
Connected to kegboard.local.
Escape character is '^]'.
info: kegboard-particle device_id=3f0000000000000000000001 version=0.1.0
```

### Serial Interface

Meter updates are also published on the serial port, in the same message format
as the TCP server.

### Cloud Interface

If there is no TCP client connected, the device will instead report status, up to once a second, to the Particle Cloud.
